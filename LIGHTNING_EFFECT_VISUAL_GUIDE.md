### Background Animation (Continuous Loop)

```
THE ELECTRICAL ENVIRONMENT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

                    ✦ LIGHTNING STRIKE ✦

    A bright cyan bolt suddenly appears on the left side
    with an intense glow that radiates outward:
    
                ░░░░░░✦░░░░░░
              ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
            ░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░
          ░░░░░░░░░░    ░░░░░░░░░░░░
        ░░░░░░░░░        ✦        ░░░░░░░░░
                        (Peak glow)
        
    The glow is bright, energetic, and electric-blue colored.
    It fades quickly over about 200 milliseconds.

                    2 SECONDS LATER...

    A purple lightning bolt strikes on the right side.
    Similar glow effect, but purple/magenta colored.
    The cyan bolt has now disappeared.

                    2 MORE SECONDS...

    A pink lightning bolt strikes in the center.
    Bright magenta/pink glow radiates outward.
    
                    CONTINUOUS CYCLE...

    While you're viewing the page, this pattern continues:
    - Cyan strikes (left)
    - Purple strikes (right, offset)
    - Pink strikes (center, offset)
    
    No two ever strike at exactly the same time, creating
    the illusion of a dynamic, "alive" electrical environment.

UNDERLYING EFFECTS (Continuous):
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

Below the strikes, you'll notice:

1. ELECTRICAL FIELD
   ▁▂▃▄▅▆▇ A subtle pulsing energy field
   
   Gets slightly brighter and dimmer continuously.
   Creates a sense of active electrical current.
   Three colored zones (cyan, purple, pink).

2. AMBIENT GLOW
   A very subtle floating glow effect that moves
   slowly (takes 20 seconds to complete one cycle).
   
   Almost imperceptible but adds depth and richness.
   Drifts slightly upward then back to starting position.

OVERALL EFFECT:
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

The page background feels:
  ✓ Alive and active
  ✓ Technical and futuristic
  ✓ Professional and premium
  ✓ Energetic without being distracting
  ✓ Cohesive across all pages
```

## Timing Reference

If you want to observe the specific timing of strikes:

```
00:00 - Lightning #1 (Cyan) strikes
        └─ Visible for ~200ms
        └─ Fades by ~400ms

00:02 - Lightning #2 (Purple) strikes
        └─ Visible for ~200ms
        └─ Fades by ~400ms

00:04 - Lightning #3 (Pink) strikes
        └─ Visible for ~200ms
        └─ Fades by ~400ms

00:08 - Lightning #1 (Cyan) strikes again (repeats 8s cycle)
        └─ Pattern now offset from the beginning...

...

The electrical field pulses continuously (6s cycle)
The ambient glow drifts continuously (20s cycle)
```

## Color Observations

### Bolt #1 (Cyan) - #00d4ff
When this strikes, you'll see:
- Bright cyan electric color
- Surrounding glow is bright blue
- When paired with other bolts, creates lighter blues

### Bolt #2 (Purple) - #7c3aed
When this strikes, you'll see:
- Deep purple/violet color
- Surrounding glow is vibrant purple
- Creates magical, royal atmosphere

### Bolt #3 (Pink) - #ff006e
When this strikes, you'll see:
- Bright pink/magenta color
- Surrounding glow is hot pink
- Creates energetic, exciting feeling

### Color Blending
When two bolts' glow effects overlap:
- Cyan + Purple = Blue (cool, technical)
- Purple + Pink = Magenta (vibrant, energetic)
- Cyan + Pink = Light pink (warm, welcoming)

## Quick Effect Tour (What to Look For)

### First 10 Seconds
```
00:00  ✓ See first cyan strike on the left
       ✓ Notice the bright glow radiating outward
       ✓ Watch it fade out smoothly

00:02  ✓ Purple bolt strikes on the right side
       ✓ Glow effect is visible but in different location
       ✓ Creates sense of movement

00:04  ✓ Pink bolt strikes in the center
       ✓ Three bolts now cycling creates interesting pattern
       ✓ Notice they never coincide

00:06  ✓ Electrical field pulses subtly
       ✓ Ambient glow drifts almost imperceptibly

00:08  ✓ Cyan strikes again (pattern repeats but offset)
       ✓ Continue watching for 2-3 minutes to see full effect

---

## If You Want to See It Differently

### Speed Up the Animation
Add this to browser DevTools Console:
```javascript
// Note: This is for testing only, don't use in production
document.querySelector('.lightning-bolt-1').style.animationDuration = '4s';
document.querySelector('.lightning-bolt-2').style.animationDuration = '3.5s';
document.querySelector('.lightning-bolt-3').style.animationDuration = '4.5s';
```

### Slow Down the Animation
In browser DevTools → Elements → Find `.lightning-bg` → Styles
Add: `animation-play-state: paused;` to see the exact moment of a strike

### Change Colors (Testing)
In browser DevTools → Elements → Find `.lightning-bolt-1` → Styles
Change: `stroke: #ff0000;` to make it red (for example)

---

## Browser DevTools Inspection

### To Monitor the Animation

1. **Open DevTools** (F12 or Cmd+Option+I)
