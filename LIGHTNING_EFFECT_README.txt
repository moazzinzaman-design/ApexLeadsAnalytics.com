## 🎨 Animation Details

### Lightning Strike Timing
```
Every 10 seconds (approximately):

Second 0:  Cyan bolt strikes (left side)
Second 2:  Purple bolt strikes (right side)  
Second 4:  Pink bolt strikes (center)
Second 8:  Cyan strikes again (cycle repeats with offset)

Result: Continuous, non-repetitive lightning activity
```

### Glow Effect
- Bright, intense glow radiates from each strike
- Fade-in: 200ms (strike appears quickly)
- Peak glow: 300ms (maximum brightness)
- Fade-out: 400ms (smooth disappearance)
- Total visibility: ~500ms per strike

### Color Blending
When glow effects overlap:
- Cyan + Purple = Blue (technical feel)
- Purple + Pink = Magenta (energetic feel)
- Cyan + Pink = Light pink (welcoming feel)
